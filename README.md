## Description

This is a sample app using modern Android components and patterns.

Concepts and libraries used for building this app:
- Retrofit (https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
- Moshi (https://github.com/square/moshi)
- MVVM with Jetpack Architecture components (https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide)
- Hilt for dependency injection (https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android)
- Paging2 Library (https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging)
- Coroutines (https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines)
- Room (https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room)
- Picasso (https://square.github.io/picasso/)

For testing I used Mockito and JUnit (https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests), algon with two libraries for coroutine and architecture testing.
